**The git status Command**

The <code>git status</code> command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.It lets you see which changes have been staged,which haven't,and which files aren't being tracked by Git.Status output does not show you any information regarding the committed project history.For this,you need to use <code>git log</code>.

#### 使用方式

#### 讨论

The <code>git status</code> command is a relatively straightforward command.It simply shows you what's been going on with <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code>.Status messages also include relevant instructions for 
staging/unstaging files.Sample output showing the three main categories of a <code>git status</code> call is included below:

	# On branch master
	# Changes to be committed:
	# (use "git reset HEAD ..." to unstage)
	#
	# modified: hello.py
	#
	# Changes not staged for commit:
	# (use "git add ..." to update what will be committed)
	# (use "git checkout -- ..." to discard changes in working directory)
	#
	# modified: main.py
	#
	# Untracked files:
	# (use "git add ..." to include in what will be committed)
	#
	# hello.pyc
