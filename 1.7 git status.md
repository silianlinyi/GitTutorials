**The git status Command**

The <code>git status</code> command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.It lets you see which changes have been staged,which haven't,and which files aren't being tracked by Git.Status output does not show you any information regarding the committed project history.For this,you need to use <code>git log</code>.

#### 使用方式

	git status

List which files are staged,unstaged,and untracked.

#### 讨论

The <code>git status</code> command is a relatively straightforward command.It simply shows you what's been going on with <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code>.Status messages also include relevant instructions for 
staging/unstaging files.Sample output showing the three main categories of a <code>git status</code> call is included below:

	# On branch master
	# Changes to be committed:
	# (use "git reset HEAD ..." to unstage)
	#
	# modified: hello.py
	#
	# Changes not staged for commit:
	# (use "git add ..." to update what will be committed)
	# (use "git checkout -- ..." to discard changes in working directory)
	#
	# modified: main.py
	#
	# Untracked files:
	# (use "git add ..." to include in what will be committed)
	#
	# hello.pyc

**Ignoring Files**

Untracked files typically fall into two categories.They're either files that have just been added to the project and
haven't been committed yet,or they're compiled binaries like <code>.pyc .obj .exe </code>etc.While it's definitely
beneficial to include the former in the <code>git status</code> output,the latter can make it hard to see what's actually
going on in your repository.

For this reason, Git lets you completely ignore files by placing paths in a special file called <code>.gitignore</code>.
Any files that you'd like to ignore should be included on a separate line, and the * symbol can be used as a wildcard.
For example,adding the following to a <code>.gitignore</code> file in your project root will prevent compiled Python
modules from appearing in git status:

	*.pyc
