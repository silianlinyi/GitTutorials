### 1.5 git add

The <code>git add</code> command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.It tells Git that you want
to include updates to a particular file in the next commit.However,<code>git add</code> doesn't really affect the 
repository in any significant way ---- changes are not actually recorded until you run <code>git commit</code>.

In conjunction with these command,you'll also need <code>git status</code> to view the state of the working directory
and the staging area.

#### 使用方式

    git add <file>

Stage all changes in <code>\<file\></code> for the next commit.

    git add <directory>

Stage all changes in <directory> for the next commit.

    git add -p

Begin an interactive staging session that lets you choose portions of a file to add to the next commit.This will present
you with a chunk of changes and prompt you for a command.Use <code>y</code> to stage the chunk,<code>n</code> to ignore
the chunk,<code>s</code> to split it into smaller chunks, <code>e</code> to manually edit the chunk, and <code>q</code>
to exit.
