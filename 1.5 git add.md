### 1.5 git add

The <code>git add</code> command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.It tells Git that you want
to include updates to a particular file in the next commit.However,<code>git add</code> doesn't really affect the 
repository in any significant way ---- changes are not actually recorded until you run <code>git commit</code>.

In conjunction with these command,you'll also need <code>git status</code> to view the state of the working directory
and the staging area.

#### 使用方式

    git add <file>

Stage all changes in <code>\<file\></code> for the next commit.

    git add <directory>

Stage all changes in <directory> for the next commit.

    git add -p

Begin an interactive staging session that lets you choose portions of a file to add to the next commit.This will present
you with a chunk of changes and prompt you for a command.Use <code>y</code> to stage the chunk,<code>n</code> to ignore
the chunk,<code>s</code> to split it into smaller chunks, <code>e</code> to manually edit the chunk, and <code>q</code>
to exit.

#### 讨论

The <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> commands compose the fundamental Git workflow.These are the two
commands that every Git user needs to understand,regardless of their team's collaboration model.They are the means to
record versions of a project into the repository's history.

Developing a project revolves around the basic edit/stage/commit pattern.First,you edit your files in the working
directory.When you're ready to save a copy of the current state of the project,you stage changes with <code>git add .</code>
After you're happy with the staged snapshot,you commit it to the project history with <code>git commit .</code>

// TODO Add a image.

The <code>git add</code> command should not be confused with <code>svn add</code>,which adds a file to the repository.
Instead,<code>git add</code> works on the more abstract level of changes.This means that <code>git add</code> needs
to be called every time you alter a file,whereas <code>svn add</code> only needs to be called once for each file.
It may sound redundant,but this workflow makes it much easier to keep a project organized.

**The Staging Area**

The staging area is one of Git's more unique features,and it can take some time to wrap your head around it if you're
coming from an SVN (or even a Mercurial)background.It helps to think of it as a buffer between the working directory
and the project history.

Instead of committing all of the changes you're made since the last commit,the stage lets you group related changes 
into highly focused snapshots before actually committing it to the project history.This means you can makeall sorts
of edits to unrelated files,then go back and split them up into logical commits by adding related changes to the 
stage and commit them piece-by-piece.As in any revision control system,it's important to create atomic commits so that
it's easy to track down bugs and revert changes with minimal impact on the rest of the project.

#### 例子

When you're starting a new project,<code>git add</cdoe> serves the same function as <code>svn import</code>.To create
an initial commit of the current directory,use the following two commands:

    git add .
    git commit

once you're got your project up-and-running,new files can be added by passing the path to <code>git add</code>:

    git add hello.py
    git commit

The above commands can also be used to record changes to existing files.Again,Git doesn't differentiate between
staging changes in new files vs. changes in files that have already been added to the repository.
