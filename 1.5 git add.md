### 1.5 git add

The <code>git add</code> command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.It tells Git that you want
to include updates to a particular file in the next commit.However,<code>git add</code> doesn't really affect the 
repository in any significant way ---- changes are not actually recorded until you run <code>git commit</code>.

In conjunction with these command,you'll also need <code>git status</code> to view the state of the working directory
and the staging area.

#### 使用方式

    git add <file>

Stage all changes in <code>\<file\></code> for the next commit.

    git add <directory>

Stage all changes in <directory> for the next commit.

    git add -p

Begin an interactive staging session that lets you choose portions of a file to add to the next commit.This will present
you with a chunk of changes and prompt you for a command.Use <code>y</code> to stage the chunk,<code>n</code> to ignore
the chunk,<code>s</code> to split it into smaller chunks, <code>e</code> to manually edit the chunk, and <code>q</code>
to exit.

#### 讨论

The <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> commands compose the fundamental Git workflow.These are the two
commands that every Git user needs to understand,regardless of their team's collaboration model.They are the means to
record versions of a project into the repository's history.

Developing a project revolves around the basic edit/stage/commit pattern.First,you edit your files in the working
directory.When you're ready to save a copy of the current state of the project,you stage changes with <code>git add .</code>
After you're happy with the staged snapshot,you commit it to the project history with <code>git commit .</code>

// TODO Add a image.

The <code>git add</code> command should not be confused with <code>svn add</code>,which adds a file to the repository.
Instead,<code>git add</code> works on the more abstract level of changes.This means that <code>git add</code> needs
to be called every time you alter a file,whereas <code>svn add</code> only needs to be called once for each file.
It may sound redundant,but this workflow makes it much easier to keep a project organized.
