### 1.5 git add

The <code>git add</code> command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.It tells Git that you want
to include updates to a particular file in the next commit.However,<code>git add</code> doesn't really affect the 
repository in any significant way ---- changes are not actually recorded until you run <code>git commit</code>.

In conjunction with these command,you'll also need <code>git status</code> to view the state of the working directory
and the staging area.
