### 1.6 git commit

The <code>git commit</cdoe> command commits the staged snapshot to the project history.Committed snapshots can be
thought of as "safe" versions of a project ---- Git will never change them unless you explicity ask it to.Along with
<code>git add</code>, this is one of the most important Git commands.

While they share the same name,this command is nothing like <code>svn commit</code>.Snapshots are committed to the 
lcoal repository,and this requires absolutely no interaction with other Git repositories.

#### 使用方式

    git commit

Commit the staged snapshot.This will launch a text editor prompting you for a commit message.After you've entered
a message,save the file and close the editor to create the actual commit.

    git commit -m "<message>"

Commit the staged snapshot,but instead of launching a text editor,user <message> as the commit message.

    git commit -a

Commit a snapshot of all changes in the working directory.This only includes modifications to tracked files
(those that have been added with <code>git add</code> at some point in their history).
