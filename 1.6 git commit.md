### 1.6 git commit

The <code>git commit</code> command commits the staged snapshot to the project history.Committed snapshots can be
thought of as "safe" versions of a project ---- Git will never change them unless you explicity ask it to.Along with
<code>git add</code>, this is one of the most important Git commands.

While they share the same name,this command is nothing like <code>svn commit</code>.Snapshots are committed to the 
lcoal repository,and this requires absolutely no interaction with other Git repositories.

#### 使用方式

    git commit

Commit the staged snapshot.This will launch a text editor prompting you for a commit message.After you've entered
a message,save the file and close the editor to create the actual commit.

    git commit -m "<message>"

Commit the staged snapshot,but instead of launching a text editor,user <message> as the commit message.

    git commit -a

Commit a snapshot of all changes in the working directory.This only includes modifications to tracked files
(those that have been added with <code>git add</code> at some point in their history).

#### 讨论

Snapshots are always committed to the local repository.This is fundamentally different from SVN,wherein the working copy
is committed to the central repository.In contrast,Git doesn't force you to interact with the central repository until
you're ready.Just as the staging area ia a buffer between the working directory and the project history,each developer's
local repository is a buffer between their contributions and the central repository.

This changes the basic development model for Git users.Instead of making a change and committing it directly to the 
central repo,Git developers have the oppotunity to accumulate commits in their local repo.This has many advantages
over SVN-style collaboration:it makes it easier to split up a feature into atomic commits,keep related commits
grouped together,and clean up local history before publishing it to the central repository.It also lets developers
work in an isolated environment,deferring integration until they're at a convenient break point.

**Snapshots,Not Differences**

Aside from the practical distinctions between SVN and Git,their underlying implementation also follow entirely
divergent design philosophies.Whereas SVN tracks differences of a file,Git's version control model is based on
snapshots.For example,an SVN commit consists of a diff compared to the original file added to the repository.
Git,on the other hand,records the entire contents of each file in every commit.

// TODO

This makes many Git operations much faster than SVN,since a particular version of a file doesn't have to be 
"assembled" from its diffs ---- the complete revision of each file is immediately available from Git's internal
database.

Git snapshot model has a far-reaching impact on virtually every aspect of its version control model,affecting
everything from its branching and merging tools to its collaboration workflows.

#### 例子

The following example assumes you've edited some content in a file called <code>hello.py</code> and are ready to
commit it to the project history.First,you need to stage the file with<code>git add</code>,then you can commit
the staged snapshot.

    git add hello.py
    git commit

This will open a text editor (customizable via git config) asking for a commit message,along with a list of what's
being committed:

    # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
    # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
    # On branch master
    # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.
    #   (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
    #
    # Changes to be committed:
    #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
    #
    #	new file:   hello.py
    #

Git doesn't require commit messages to follow any specific formatting constraints,but the canonical format is to
summarize the entire commit on the first line in less than 50 characters,leave a blank line,then a detailed 
explanation of what's been changed.For example:

    Change the message displayed by hello.py
    
    - Update the sayHello() function to output the user's name
    - Change the sayGoodbye() function to a friendlier message

**Note** that many developers also like to use present tense in their commit messages.This makes them read more
like actions on the repository,which makes many of the history-rewriting operations more intuitive.
