### 1.6 git commit

The <code>git commit</code> command commits the staged snapshot to the project history.Committed snapshots can be
thought of as "safe" versions of a project ---- Git will never change them unless you explicity ask it to.Along with
<code>git add</code>, this is one of the most important Git commands.

While they share the same name,this command is nothing like <code>svn commit</code>.Snapshots are committed to the 
lcoal repository,and this requires absolutely no interaction with other Git repositories.

#### 使用方式

    git commit

Commit the staged snapshot.This will launch a text editor prompting you for a commit message.After you've entered
a message,save the file and close the editor to create the actual commit.

    git commit -m "<message>"

Commit the staged snapshot,but instead of launching a text editor,user <message> as the commit message.

    git commit -a

Commit a snapshot of all changes in the working directory.This only includes modifications to tracked files
(those that have been added with <code>git add</code> at some point in their history).

#### 讨论

Snapshots are always committed to the local repository.This is fundamentally different from SVN,wherein the working copy
is committed to the central repository.In contrast,Git doesn't force you to interact with the central repository until
you're ready.Just as the staging area ia a buffer between the working directory and the project history,each developer's
local repository is a buffer between their contributions and the central repository.

This changes the basic development model for Git users.Instead of making a change and committing it directly to the 
central repo,Git developers have the oppotunity to accumulate commits in their local repo.This has many advantages
over SVN-style collaboration:it makes it easier to split up a feature into atomic commits,keep related commits
grouped together,and clean up local history before publishing it to the central repository.It also lets developers
work in an isolated environment,deferring integration until they're at a convenient break point.
