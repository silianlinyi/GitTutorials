**The git log Command**

The <code>git log</code> command displays committed snapshots.It lets you list the project history,filter it,and search for
specific changes.While <code>git status</code> lets you inspect **the working directory and the staging area**, <code>
git log</code> only operates on the **committed history**.

// TODO

Log output can be customized in several ways,from simply filtering commits to displaying them in a completely user-defined
format.Some of the most common configurations of <code>git log</code> are presented below.

#### 使用方式

	git log

Display the entire commit history using the default formatting.If the output takes up more than one screen,you can use
Space to scroll and q to exit.

	git log -n <limit>

Limit the number of commits by <limit>.For example,<code>git log -n 3</code> will display only 3 commits.

	git log --oneline

Condense each commit to a single line.This is useful for getting a high-level overview of the project history.

	git log --stat

Along with the ordinary <code>git log</code> information,include which files were altered and the relative number of lines
that were added or deleted from each of them.

	git log -p

Display the patch representing each commit.This shows the full diff of each commit,which is the most detailed view you 
can have of your project history.

	git log --author-"<pattern>"

Search for commits by a particular author.The argument can be a plain string or a regular expression.

	git log --grep="<pattern>"

Search for commits with a commit message that matches <pattern>,which can be a plain string or a regular expression.

	git log <since>..<until>

Show only commits that occur between <since> and <until>.Both arguments can be either a commit ID,a branch name,HEAD,or
any other kind of revision reference.

	git log <file>

Only display commits that include the specified file.This is an easy way to see the history of a particular file.

	git log --graph --decorate --oneline

A few useful options to consider.The <code>--graph</code> flag that will draw a text based graph of the commits on the
left hand side of the commit messages.<code>--decorate</code> adds the names of branches or tags of the commits that
are shown.<code>--oneline</code> shows the commit information on a single line making it easier to browser through
commits at-a-glance.
