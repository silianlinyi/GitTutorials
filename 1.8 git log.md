**The git log Command**

The <code>git log</code> command displays committed snapshots.It lets you list the project history,filter it,and search for
specific changes.While <code>git status</code> lets you inspect **the working directory and the staging area**, <code>
git log</code> only operates on the **committed history**.

// TODO

Log output can be customized in several ways,from simply filtering commits to displaying them in a completely user-defined
format.Some of the most common configurations of <code>git log</code> are presented below.

#### 使用方式

	git log

Display the entire commit history using the default formatting.If the output takes up more than one screen,you can use
Space to scroll and q to exit.

	git log -n <limit>
