## 一、Git Basics

The Git Basics tutorial provides a succinct overview of the most important Git commands. First,the **Setting Up a Repository**
section explains all of the tools you need to start a new version-controlled project.Then,the remaining sections introduce
your everyday Git commands.

By the end of this module,you should be able to create a Git repository,record snapshots of your project for safekeeping,
and view your project's history.

### 1.1 Overview

#### git init

**Setting Up a Git Repository.** The <code>git init</code> command initializes a new Git repository.If you want to place
a project under revision control,this is the first command you need to learn.

#### git clone

The <code>git clone</code> command creates a copy of an existing Git repository. Cloning is the most common way for
developers to obtain a working copy of a central repository.

#### git config

The <code>git config</code> command is a convenient way to set configuration options for your Git installation. You'll
typically only need to use this immediately after installing Git on a new development machine.

#### git add

**Recording Snapshots** The <code>git add</code> command moves changes from the working directory to the staging area.
This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.

#### git commit

The <code>git commit</code> takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add,
this defines the basic workflow for all Git users.

#### git status

**Inspecting a Git Repository** The <code>git status</code> command displays the state of the working directory and 
the staged snapshot. You'll want to run this in conjunction with git add and git commit to see exactly what's being
included in the next snapshot.

#### git log

The <code>git log</code> command lets you explore the previous revisions of a project. It provides several formatting
options for displaying committed snapshots.

### 1.2 git init

The <code>git init</code> command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned 
project to a Git repository or initialize a new empty repository. Most of the other Git commands are not available
outside of an initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you'll run in a new project.

执行<code>git init</code>命令会在项目根目录创建一个.git子目录，该目录中包含了仓库所有的必要的信息。除了.git目录之外，
现有的项目保持不变（不像SVN，Git不要求每个子目录都包含一个.git目录）。
