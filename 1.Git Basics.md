## 一、Git Basics

The Git Basics tutorial provides a succinct overview of the most important Git commands. First,the **Setting Up a Repository**
section explains all of the tools you need to start a new version-controlled project.Then,the remaining sections introduce
your everyday Git commands.

By the end of this module,you should be able to create a Git repository,record snapshots of your project for safekeeping,
and view your project's history.

### 1.1 Overview

#### git init

**Setting Up a Git Repository.** The <code>git init</code> command initializes a new Git repository.If you want to place
a project under revision control,this is the first command you need to learn.

#### git clone

The <code>git clone</code> command creates a copy of an existing Git repository. Cloning is the most common way for
developers to obtain a working copy of a central repository.

#### git config

The <code>git config</code> command is a convenient way to set configuration options for your Git installation. You'll
typically only need to use this immediately after installing Git on a new development machine.

#### git add

**Recording Snapshots** The <code>git add</code> command moves changes from the working directory to the staging area.
This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.

#### git commit

The <code>git commit</code> takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add,
this defines the basic workflow for all Git users.

#### git status

**Inspecting a Git Repository** The <code>git status</code> command displays the state of the working directory and 
the staged snapshot. You'll want to run this in conjunction with git add and git commit to see exactly what's being
included in the next snapshot.

#### git log

The <code>git log</code> command lets you explore the previous revisions of a project. It provides several formatting
options for displaying committed snapshots.

### 1.2 git init

The <code>git init</code> command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned 
project to a Git repository or initialize a new empty repository. Most of the other Git commands are not available
outside of an initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you'll run in a new project.

执行<code>git init</code>命令会在项目根目录创建一个.git子目录，该目录中包含了仓库所有的必要的信息。除了.git目录之外，
现有的项目保持不变（不像SVN，Git不要求每个子目录都包含一个.git目录）。

#### 使用方式

    git init

Transform the current directory into a Git repository. This adds a .git folder to the current directory and makes
it possible to start recording revisions of the project.

    git init <directory>

Create an empty Git repository in the specified directory. Running this command will create a new folder called
<directory> containing nothing but the .git subdirectory.

    git init --bare <directory>

Initialize an empty Git repository, but omit the working directory. Shared repositories should always be created
with the --bare flag (see discussion below). Conventionally, repositories initialized with the --bare flag end in 
.git. For example, the bare version of a repository called my-project should be stored in a directory called
my-project.git

#### 讨论

Compared to SVN, the <code>git init</code> command is an incredibly easy way to create new version-controlled 
projects. Git doesn't require you to create a repository, import files,and check out a working copy.All you
have to do is cd into your project folder and run <code>git init</code>, and you'll have a fully functional
Git repository.

However,for most projects, <code>git init</code> only needs to be executed once to create a central repository-
developers typically don't use git init to create their local repositories.Instead,they'll unsally use 
<code>git clone</code> to copy an existing repository onto their local machine.

#### Bare Repositories

The <code>--bare</code> flag creates a repository that doesn't have a working directory, making it impossible to
edit files and commit changes in that repository. Central repositories should always be created as bare repositories
because pushing branches to a non-bare repository has the potential to overwrite changes.Think of --bare as a way
to mark a repository as a storage facillity, opposed to a development environment.This means that for virtually 
all Git workflows,the central reposity is bare,and developers local repositories are non-bare.

#### 例子

Since <code>git clone</code> is a more convenient way to create local copies of a project, the most common use case
for <code>git clone</code> is to create a central repository:

    ssh @
    cd path/above/repo
    git init --bare my-project.git

First,you SSH into the server that will contain your central repository.Then,you navigate to wherever you'd like to
store the project.Finally,you use the --bare flag to create a central storage repository.Developers would then 
clone my-project.git to create a local copy on their development machine.

### 1.3 git clone

The <code>git clone </code>command copies an existing Git repository. This is sort of like <code>svn checkout </code>,
except the "working copy" is a full-fledged Git repository --- it has its own history,manages its own files,and is a
completely isolated environment from the original repository.

As a convenience,cloning automatically creates a remote connection called origin pointing back to the origin repository.
This makes it very easy to interact with a central repository.

#### 使用方式

    git clone <repo>

Clone the repository located at <repo> onto the local machine.The original repository can be located on the local
filesystem or on a remote machine accessible via HTTP or SSH.

    git clone <repo> <directory>

Clone the repository located at <repo> into the folder called <directory> on the local machine.

#### 讨论

If a project has already been set up in a central repository,the <code>git clone</code> command is the most common way
for users to obtain a development copy.Like <code>git init</code>,cloning is generally a one-time operation ---
once a developer has obtained a working copy,all version control operations and collaborations are managed throuth
their local repository.

**Repo-To-Repo Collaboration**

It's important to understand that Git's idea of a "working copy" is very different from the working copy you get
by checking out code from an SVN repository.Unlike SVN,Git makes no distinction between the working copy and the 
central repository --- they are all full-fledged Git repositories.

This makes collaborating with Git fundamentally different than with SVN.Whereas SVN depends on the relationship
between the central repository and the working copy,Git's collaboration model is based on repository-to-repository
interaction.Instead of checking a working copy into SVN's central repository,you push of pull commits from one
repository to another.

// TODO

Of course,there's nothing stopping you from giving certain Git repos special meaning.For example,by simply
designating one Git repo as the "central" repository,it's possible to replicate a Centralized workflow using Git.
The point is,this is accomplished through conventions rather than being hardwired into the VCS itself.

#### 例子

The example below demonstrates how to obtain a local copy of a central repository stored on a server accessible at
example.com using the SSH username john:

    git clone ssh://john@example.com/path/to/my-project.git
    cd my-project
    # Start working on the project

The first command initializes a new Git repository in the my-project folder on your local machine and populates
it with the contents of the central repository.Then,you can cd into the project and start editing files,committing 
snapshots,and interacting with other repositories.Also note that the .git extension is omitted from the cloned
repository.This reflects the non-bare status of the local copy.
